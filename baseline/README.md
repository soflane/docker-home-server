# Baseline 

### About

This is the base Docker stack that come with any web services host. It comes with the necessary tools to manage docker containers and a reverse proxy to expose any service.

This stack composes :

-  [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) 
   Reverse proxy for Docker container with automatic Lets encrypt certificates creation.
-  [Flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame) 
   Dashboard automatically updates by containers labels.
-  [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
-  [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/)
-  [ddclient](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-ddclient)
   DynDNS client
-  [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) 
   Automatic Docker images updates

By default, the stack exposes the HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports

This configuration is mean to be used mainly with environment variables.
However, ddclient and eventually the traefik dynamic configuration for external hosts

#### Side note about Flame

Flame is a dashboard/start page for your server. The choice of using this one especially was made because of the easy setup brought by @pawelmalak. To add a link to your start page you can add it directly from the UI (for external links) or you can simply add the following labels to your web service *:

```yaml
labels:
      # Enable flame dashboard link
      - flame.type=application # "app" works too
      - flame.name=app-name
      - flame.url=https://yourlink.com
      - flame.icon=icon-name # Optional, default is "docker"
```

The icon names can be found at [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

*: I will update the labels in other compose files later

## Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repository 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/soflane/docker-instances
$ cd docker-instances/baseline/
```

#### 2. Edit ddclient config file

```bash
$ nano ddclient/ddclient.conf
```

#### 3. (Optional) Edit traefik dynamic conf

This is only needed if you need to make proxy redirections to other hosts in your subnet (Ex. your router, network camera, ...) or some services outside of Docker.

```bash
$ cp traefik-conf/add-conf.yml.dist traefik-conf/add-conf.yml 
$ nano traefik-conf/add-conf.yml 
```

#### 4. Edit .env file 

```bash
$ cp .env.dist .env
$ nano .env
```

PS: I use nano (you can judge me for that, idc :p), you can use whatever text editor you want 

#### 5. Start the docker-compose stack 

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
